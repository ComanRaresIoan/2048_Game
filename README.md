This code implements the game logic for a simplified version of the 2048 game. Let's describe its capabilities:

1. Game Initialization: The start_game() function initializes the game grid with a 4x4 matrix filled with zeros. It also prints the instructions for playing the game.

2. Adding New 2: The add_new_2() function randomly adds a new tile with the value of 2 to an empty cell in the grid.

3. Current State: The get_current_state() function checks the current state of the game. It returns "WON" if the player has reached the 2048 tile, "GAME NOT OVER" if there are still empty cells or adjacent cells with the same value, and "LOST" if the player cannot make any valid moves.

4. Movement Functions: There are functions to handle movements in four directions: move_left(), move_right(), move_up(), and move_down(). These functions implement the core logic of the game, including compressing, merging, reversing, and transposing the grid based on the direction of movement.

5. Main Game Loop: The main part of the code runs a loop where the player is prompted to enter a command ('W', 'S', 'A', 'D' for up, down, left, and right respectively). Based on the input, the corresponding movement function is called. The current state of the game is checked after each move, and a new 2 tile is added if the game is not over.

Overall, this code provides the basic functionalities required to play a simplified version of the 2048 game. However, it lacks features such as score tracking, graphical user interface (GUI), and advanced gameplay mechanics present in the original 2048 game.
